I am a 23 yeard old Economics Student at the Central University of Venezuela (known in Spanish as UCV). I learned how to code in R recently and every day is an opportunity to learn something new. I'm currently about 10 months into my R journey and it has been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration as well (especially when trying to learn regular expressions).

The aspect of Data Science that I've enjoy the most so far is Data visualization. I hope to have a job one day where I get to communicate stories with data visualizations.

Now I'm taking my time learning statistics and learning the basics of Python 🐍. I'm also contributing weekly to the #Tidytuesday challenge from the `R4DS Online Learning Community`. You can find my contributions in my [R_tidytuesday](https://github.com/luisfrein/R_Tidytuesday) repository.
